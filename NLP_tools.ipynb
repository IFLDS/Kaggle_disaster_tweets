Brevik was inspired by NHL '94 and similar sports games to make it so that players only had to select a \n","pre-determined class and would be able to jump into the game with minimal interactions. Brevik also wanted these classes to be \n","combinations of typical character classes so that players would be not overly restricted in what type of attacks or equipment \n","they could use. A further departure from the roguelike approach was to make the loot system from felled monsters more expansive.\n","[20] According to Matt Barton, the game Telengard, released by Avalon Hill in 1982, influenced the development of Diablo.[21] \n","Barton and Bill Loguidice also cite The Legend of Zelda series as an influence on Diablo, particularly its move towards real-time \n","action, away from the stat-heavy, turn-based gameplay of earlier computer RPGs.[22] Brevik also wanted a \"modern and cool\" \n","interface intended to bring the quick directness of console games as well as Doom (1993) to computer RPGs.[23] He had named the \n","game idea Diablo based on Mount Diablo, which was where Brevik lived when he conceived of the game idea.[20] Condor started \n","development while pitching the game to publishers. Bill Roper said that the team's \"initial pitch, in a nutshell, was to take \n","the excitement and randomness of games like Moria, Nethack, and Rogue, and bring them into the 1990s with fantastic graphics and \n","sound\".[24] Condor Games had tried to shop Brevik's idea to other publishers but was turned down on the grounds that \"RPGs are \n","dead\".[23] While Condor sought a publisher for Brevik's idea, Blizzard had completed their next game, the real-time strategy \n","Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994) for the personal computer. Condor Games saw Blizzard shared their same interest in personal \n","computer games and pitched Brevik's idea to them. About three to four months into development, Blizzard offered to work with \n","them on Diablo but requested two major changes, to make it real-time and to have multiplayer, having had done these steps during \n","their work in creating Warcraft.[23] Brevik did not want to change the turn-based nature of his game at first fearing that it would \n","add extra time onto development, and Condor's development team put the idea to a vote, with the real-time approach winning out.[20] \n","Brevik prepared Blizzard for the potential added development time and to ask for extra development costs, and then on a Friday \n","afternoon as everyone had left, started to toy around with converting the game from turn-based to real-time; within hours he had \n","the basics of the system in place, and was able to show this to the rest of Condor by the following Monday. They kept this news \n","from Blizzard for a short while but eventually revealed how fast they had come up with the change, which Blizzard readily accepted.[20] \n","The game was also originally conceived to be made in claymation (much like ClayFighter), but they decided to have a 3D isometric \n","style instead.[25][26][27] In 1996, as development on Diablo continued, Blizzard acquired Condor Games. Blizzard named their Irving, \n","California location to Blizzard South and Condor Games to Blizzard north to distinguish their studios.[28] Around eight months before \n","the planned release, Blizzard South were finishing up Warcraft II, and began focusing on the upcoming release of Diablo. Blizzard did \n","not want to rely on existing online gaming services like Total Entertainment Network for matchmaking. While Blizzard North finished up \n","Diablo, Blizzard South began development of the basis of Battle.net. According to Brevik, when Blizzard South came up to start to see \n","how Diablo's multiplayer code would incorporate with Battle.net, they discovered then that Diablo had no multiplayer code as Brevik \n","nor others had any idea how to write such code. Blizzard South sent employees up to Blizzard North, including Mike O'Brien, at that \n","point to incorporate multiplayer for Diablo and interface with Battle.net over the last six months of development.[29]\"\"\"\n","\n","tr4w = TextRank4Keyword()\n","tr4w.analyze(text, candidate_pos = ['NOUN', 'PROPN'], window_size=4, lower=True)\n","keywords = tr4w.get_keywords(mean_threshold =
